Convection cells in Earth’s lower mantle drive the tectonic plates on the surface. Earth’s core heats the rock material of the lower mantle. As it is heated, it expands and becomes LESS DENSE. The lower mantle rock material rises toward Earth’s surface. Tectonic plates move apart over the rising part of a convection cell. Basaltic lava is extruded between the plates along the mid-ocean ridge. The basaltic lava adds to the plates so that they grow in size. Over time, as newly-formed plate material moves away from the mid-ocean ridge, it ages, cools, and becomes denser. The cooler, denser edge of a tectonic plate eventually sinks below another tectonic plate and enters the mantle. This sinking process is called subduction. As the subducting plate enters the mantle, it cools the adjacent mantle material. Cooling makes the nearby material denser, and it sinks deeper into the mantle. This sinking completed the mantle convection cell
