# Songify 2.0

This is a dev branch for Songify v2. It is currently **not** usable.

## Features

The most relevant feature of Songify v2 is its modularity. It features a plugin system which can add new functionality or music sources. 
This way you can add your favourite music player to Songify.

Songify v2 comes bundled with direct fetching support for Spotify.

## Plugin Store

Songify v2 comes bundled with a plugin store. From there you can download new Plugins created by the Songify team or the community, 
without having the hassle of downloading and installing the plugins manually.

**Submitting plugins to the plugin store**

To submit your plugin to the plugin store, create a pull request to the songify plugin repository (which does not exist yet).
Modify the plugins.json file with the required metadata. Once approved your plugin will appear in the plugin store.

## Plugins

Plugins are extensions for Songify. A plugin can either add a new song information source or a new feature (e.g. spotify song requests with twitch integration).
There will be a guide on how to create your own plugin, but that won't happen until songify 2.0 is in a usable state.
